# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-GUI
A Python program that uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize hand gestures from a live video feed. It displays the recognized gesture on the screen, shows the video in black and white, and provides the status of each finger (thumb, index, middle, ring, and little) as extended (1) or not (0).
